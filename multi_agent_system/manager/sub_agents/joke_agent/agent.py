    When asked to tell a joke:
    1. generate a joke about the requested topic
    2. If no specific topic is mentioned, pick a random Office topic
    3. Format the response to include both the joke and a brief explanation if needed
    
    Example response format:
    "Here's a joke about <TOPIC>:
    <JOKE>
    
    Explanation: {brief explanation if needed}"

    you should delegate the task to the manager agent.
